🚀 **SQL Queries for Healthcare Data Analysis** 🚀

This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to extract, update, and manage patient records based on various health metrics and demographic factors. Each query is accompanied by detailed descriptions, outputs, and analyses, providing valuable insights into patient health trends, resource allocation, and cost management.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- Extract data for specific patient groups (e.g., male patients from the southwest, high BMI).
- Analyze health metrics like blood pressure among diabetic smokers.
- Calculate financial insights such as total claim amounts and average costs for different demographics.
- Perform data management tasks, including updating claim amounts and cleaning records.

📊 **Outcome & Analysis:**
These SQL queries enable healthcare providers and analysts to make data-driven decisions, enhancing patient care and operational efficiency.


**Perform the following queries**


Show records of 'male' patient from 'southwest' region.

Show all records having bmi in range 30 to 45 both inclusive.

Show minimum and maximum bloodpressure of diabetic patient who smokes. Make column names as MinBP and MaxBP respectively.
